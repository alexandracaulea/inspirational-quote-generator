# Inspirational Quote Generator

On September 22, 2020 I committed to #100DaysOfFrontEnd where I’ll be sharing everything I’m working on related to frontend development.

Since I'm currently learning React, I decided to start working on the "Build a Random Quote Machine" project part of the [Front End Libraries Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) from freeCodeCamp.

This is a work in progress project that I will update daily, so to the code will change.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/alexandracaulea/inspirational-quote-generator`.
2. Install project dependencies by running: `yarn install`.

### Using this repo

1. For the development run: `yarn start`.
2. To build run `yarn build`.
3. To run tests: `yarn test`.
4. To build: `yarn build`.
5. To eject `yarn eject`
